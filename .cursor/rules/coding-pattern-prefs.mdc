# Coding pattern preferences

- Agents 1 and 5 must manage this document.
- Agents 2, 3, and 4 (Developer Agents) must co-manage and follow these rules to the greatest extent possible.
- Always prefer simple solutions  
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality  
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod  
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested  
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic.  
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized  
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once  
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.  
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod  
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments  
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
