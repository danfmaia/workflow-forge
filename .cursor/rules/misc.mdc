# Miscellaneous Rules

- Always favor TDD practices.
- Leave Git responsabilities to the user, unless explicitly solicited to perform Git operations.
- Always leave Git remote commands (such as `git push`) with the user.
- Always use Conventional Commits standards for commit messages.
- Use Git commands for diff checking if necessary.
- Never (or avoid the most as possible) leave the terminal in interactive mode â€“ Use suffix ` | cat` when needed.
- Use the fewest commands as possible when applying Git operations.
