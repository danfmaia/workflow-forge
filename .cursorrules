# WorkflowForge Development Plan

# Timeframe: 3.5 hours for MVP

## Project Overview

WorkflowForge is a business process automation platform that uses multi-agent orchestration to automate complex workflows. The platform includes a marketplace of pre-built workflows that can be customized, a self-improvement mechanism, and a modern React dashboard for configuration and monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Agent System Design

- Implement a modular multi-agent system using LangGraph for orchestration
- Define clear agent roles (Researcher, Processor, Approver, Optimizer)
- Create agent communication protocols and state management
- Implement self-reflection loop for workflow optimization

### Backend Requirements

- FastAPI application with the following endpoints:
  - /workflows (GET, POST) - List and create workflows
  - /agents (GET) - List available agent types
  - /execute (POST) - Run workflow with input data
  - /metrics (GET) - Retrieve performance metrics
- RAG implementation for document processing
- Workflow persistence via SQLite (for demo purposes)
- Reflection mechanism to optimize agent prompts based on results

### Frontend Requirements

- React dashboard with clean, professional UI
- Workflow marketplace display
- Workflow builder interface
- Real-time metrics visualization
- Document upload and processing interface

## Development Priorities (Time-Boxed)

1. [45min] Core agent orchestration system (LangGraph)
2. [45min] Backend API with 2 sample workflows
3. [60min] React frontend with dashboard and workflow display
4. [30min] Self-optimization loop implementation
5. [30min] Final integration and documentation

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, SQLite
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Chart.js
- AI: Hybrid approach leveraging your previous classifier work
- Deployment: Local development with Docker containerization

## Project Differentiation

- Emphasize the self-reflection component that improves workflows over time
- Implement a hybrid approach combining symbolic and neural techniques
- Focus on business metrics and ROI visualization

## Documentation Requirements

- Clear README with project overview
- Architecture diagram
- Sample workflow examples
- Performance metrics demonstration
- Future scaling considerations
